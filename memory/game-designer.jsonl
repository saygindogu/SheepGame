{"session":"2026-02-18","feature":"Wolf Predator","spec":"out/feature-wolf-predator.md","summary":"Designed a Wolf enemy that roams the canvas and chases the sheep within a difficulty-scaled detection radius. Wolves extend LocatableShape, implement Drawable, and are ticked inside the existing physicsTimer (16ms). Count scales from 0 at difficulty 1 to 4 at difficulty 10 via formula (difficultyLevel-1)/2. Instant kill on AABB overlap. Key architectural touchpoints: new Wolf class, List<Wolf> in SheepGame, additions to initilize(), physicsTimer callback, checkCollisions(), and getDrawables(). Optional SheepHungerPanel warning label. No new Timers required."}
