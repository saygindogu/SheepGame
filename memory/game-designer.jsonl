{"session":"2026-02-18","feature":"Wolf Predator","spec":"out/feature-wolf-predator.md","summary":"Designed a Wolf enemy that roams the canvas and chases the sheep within a difficulty-scaled detection radius. Wolves extend LocatableShape, implement Drawable, and are ticked inside the existing physicsTimer (16ms). Count scales from 0 at difficulty 1 to 4 at difficulty 10 via formula (difficultyLevel-1)/2. Instant kill on AABB overlap. Key architectural touchpoints: new Wolf class, List<Wolf> in SheepGame, additions to initilize(), physicsTimer callback, checkCollisions(), and getDrawables(). Optional SheepHungerPanel warning label. No new Timers required."}
{"session":"2026-02-18","feature":"Stamina and Rest Spots","spec":"out/feature-stamina-and-rest.md","summary":"Designed a fatigue/stamina mechanic: moving at speed accumulates fatigue; exhaustion progressively reduces effective max speed (down to 40% at full fatigue, no instant death). New RestingSpot objects are permanent ground-level patches that rapidly recover fatigue on overlap. fatigueScale is inverse of speed scale — harder difficulties accumulate fatigue ~54% faster at diff 10. Initial rest spot count scales from 3 (diff 1-3) down to 1 (diff 7-10). Touches: new RestingSpot.java, Sheep.java (fatigue field + tick logic + rest() method), SheepGame.java (restingSpots list, initilize, checkCollisions, getDrawables), SheepHungerPanel.java (third progress bar). No new Timers needed."}
